The implementation of a general sparse tensor canonical correlation analysis (gSTCCA) method.

We promise to relase all the codes of baseline methods and related preprocessing datasets to guarantee the reproducibility of any results presented in this paper.

Notice: Any Matlab script files that start with the "test_gSTCCA" serve as the main fuction to run our methods. You can adjust hyper-parameters and modify the adaptive structures in our proposed method. Please feel free to play with it!
